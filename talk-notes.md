# What do I want people to come away knowing?

- greta is worthwhile learning
- greta is fast, and more importantly, easy to reason with
- greta can do the things you might want to do in other software, such as STAN, nimble, JAGS, winBUGS.

# Rough Plan

- What is the problem greta is solving?
- Where is greta being used?
- Why interface to tensorflow/ TF probability?
- Focus on R code, not other code that needs to compile
- Use model objects to inspect the DAG
- MCMC output works with bayesian workflows - prior and posterior checking.

# Other misc notes?

- Do I compare it to STAN etc? I feel like I need a  "how does greta compare with ..." workflow type thing.
